In our information-rich, time-poor age, the importance of directing your focus onto the right things is growing ever more important. The purpose of atlas is to serve as your right-hand... man? Assistant? Whatever.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a filter on the information that otherwise flows straight to you, unimpeded. The roadmap is long, but this project was born of a desire simply to know what I needed to know when I needed to know it.

The goal of this project, and the reason for its being open source is that it means that the end users agency to determine what they want to and don't want to see remains entirely their own. The goal of atlas is for it to be a project that anyone can use to take more control of what information they feel they need to see or don't.

It's early days, so there are more ideas than implementations, but if you stumble on this project and have an idea that you'd like to see, feel free to create a feature request issue. I will try to get to it as soon as possible. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to lend a helping hand and see faster progress. I also appreciate any feedback that you may have.

## Setup
---
Atlas has been set up to run within a Google Cloud Project. The automated integration is still a work in progress. This choice was made because I make extensive use of Gmail and other services in the Google suite.

You can create a Google Cloud project for free, the subsequent instructions for setup can be found in the [setup readme](docs/setup.md).
